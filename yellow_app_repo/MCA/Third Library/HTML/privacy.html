                            <p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of Personal Identifiable Information collected by
our Website/App known as YELLOW APP’. We provide a platform that lists information of
local services/ offers/ discounts/ deals made available with the consent of participating
merchants/vendors to consumers/community members.</p>
                            <p>By visiting this Website/App, you agree to be bound by the Terms and Conditions of this
Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use or access our Website/App. It is
YELLOW APP&#39;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our Website/App. This Privacy Policy applies to www.bananaapps.co.uk
(hereinafter, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;YELLOW APP&quot;).</p>
                            <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information
you may provide us through the Website/App. We have adopted this privacy policy (&quot;Privacy
Policy&quot;) to explain what information may be collected on our Website/App, how we use this
information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website/App and does
not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website/App, set
forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website/App. Depending on
your activities when visiting our Website/App, you may be required to agree to additional
terms and conditions.</p>
                            <h2> Website/App Visitors</h2>
                            <p>Like most Website/App operators, YELLOW APP collects non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
request. YELLOW APP&#39;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
better understand how YELLOW APP&#39;s visitors use its Website/App. From time to time,
YELLOW APP may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website/App.</p>
                            <p>YELLOW APP also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users that may comment/enquire/provide
feedback for the Website/App. YELLOW APP only discloses logged in user and visitors IP
addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
information as described below.</p>
                            
                              
                                <h2> Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

                            <p>For years we have chosen to trust corporations with our personal data. Maybe it’s a cultural vestige of the technological optimism of postwar America, or maybe we are so eager to reach the future we’ve been promised that we are operating on blind faith. But there are signs that our enthusiasm is cracking. As we continue to hand over more of ourselves to companies, and as more of them fail to handle that relationship with respect, does there come a point when our goodwill dries up? Will trust always be something we give, or will it become something that must be earned? At what point does the cost of adoption become too high?Certain visitors to YELLOW APP&#39;s Website/Apps choose to interact with YELLOW APP in
                             ways that require YELLOW APP to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
                             and type of information that YELLOW APP gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
                            Information that maybe collected are listed as follows:

 Your contact numbers.<br>
 Your email address and registered password.<br>
 Your payment details, billing and delivery addresses, credit/debit card number and
expiration date and/or other payment instrument details.<br>
 Your location, purchase history, IP address, your browser type and language, access
times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted
from us and the referring website address.<br>
 Other information you actively submit to us or we can determine about you based on
your interactions with our Site and Services.<br>   </p>
                          <h2>Security</h2>

                            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
                            <p>Ads appearing on our Website/App may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who

hereby acknowledge and agree to YELLOW APP&#39;s use of cookies.</p>
